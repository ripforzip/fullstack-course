            The Thrill Book was an American pulp magazine published by Street & Smith in 1919. The first eight issues, edited by Harold Hersey, were a mixture of adventure and weird stories. Contributors included Greye La Spina, Charles Fulton Oursler, J. H. Coryell,
            and Seabury Quinn. Ronald Oliphant, Hersey's replacement, printed more science fiction and fantasy, though this included two stories Hersey had purchased from Murray Leinster.
